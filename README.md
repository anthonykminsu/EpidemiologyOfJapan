# Lab 04: COVID-19 Case Rates Visualization Project

## Introduction
The COVID-19 Case Rates Visualization is an interactive web-based platform designed to display the spread and intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic across the United States in 2020. The project comprises two main interactive maps (`map1.html` and `map2.html`), each offering a unique perspective on the data.

## Project Maps

### Map 1: COVID-19 Case Rates in the United States
This map (`map1.html`) visualizes the COVID-19 case rate per 1000 individuals among those aged 18 and older in U.S. counties. It uses a choropleth representation, where color intensity indicates the severity of the outbreak in each county.

### Map 2: Total COVID-19 Case Counts in U.S. Counties
The second map (`map2.html`) displays total COVID-19 case counts within U.S. counties, represented by proportional circles. The size of each circle correlates with the total number of cases, providing a clear visual representation of the pandemic's impact at the county level.

*Note: Include screenshots for both maps here.*

## Primary Functions
The main functionality of this project includes:

- Interactive mapping using Mapbox GL JS.
- Data-driven visualization, dynamically rendering based on GeoJSON inputs.
- Proportional symbol mapping (in `map2.html`), where circle sizes represent case counts.
- Choropleth mapping (in `map1.html`), displaying data density through color gradients.
- Custom legend creation, dynamically scaled to data ranges.

## Libraries in Use
- **Mapbox GL JS**: For interactive mapping functionalities.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the web interface.

## Data Sources
Data for this project was sourced from:
- The New York Times
- The U.S. Census Bureau

These sources provided comprehensive data on COVID-19 cases at the county level across the United States.

## How to Use
1. Open either of the HTML files in a web browser to view the interactive maps.
2. Hover over or click on specific map elements for detailed information.
3. Use the legend as a guide to understand the data representation.

## Code Highlights
The projectâ€™s codebase is characterized by its use of advanced mapping techniques and data handling. Key highlights include:

- Fetching and parsing GeoJSON data.
- Dynamic styling of map elements based on data attributes.
- Responsive design for accessibility across various devices.

## Future Enhancements
Future updates may include:
- Live data integration for real-time tracking.
- Additional interactivity features like search and filter tools.
